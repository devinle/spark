## Features

### Conversational Interface
Spark doesn't just generate code - it understands what you're trying to build:

```
You: @spark carousel
Spark: Perfect! Carousels are great for showcasing content.

What are you planning to use this for?
1. Image gallery (optimized for smooth transitions)
2. Testimonials (focused on readable text)
3. Hero banner (autoplay + call-to-action support)
4. Product showcase (thumbnails + zoom features)
```

### Smart Project Detection
Automatically detects your project setup and suggests the best approach:
- Framework detection (Next.js, WordPress, Vanilla)
- TypeScript/JavaScript preference
- Existing design system integration
- Component organization patterns

### One-Click Shortcuts
Quick generation for common use cases:
```
@spark faq              # FAQ accordion
@spark product-card     # Product display card
@spark hero-carousel    # Hero banner carousel
@spark contact-form     # Contact form dialog
```

### Progressive Disclosure

- **Expert Mode**: Fast-track generation with full feature control
- **Power User Flags**: Advanced customization options

## Installation Requirements

- **Cursor IDE** (recommended) - Designed for Cursor's Chat Agent
- **Git** - For installation and updates
- **Node.js 16+** (for React/TypeScript components)
- **PHP 7.4+** (for WordPress components)

Works with any project type:
- Next.js / React applications

## Component Examples

### Accordion Component
Perfect for FAQs, product details, or step-by-step guides:

```typescript
// Generated React component
import { Accordion } from '@/Accordion/Accordion';

<Accordion
  items={[
    { title: "What is your return policy?", content: "30-day returns..." },
    { title: "How do I track my order?", content: "Visit our tracking page..." }
  ]}
  variant="bordered"
  allowMultiple={false}
/>
```

### Card Component
Great for product catalogs, blog previews, team profiles:

```typescript
// Generated React component
import { Card } from '@/Card/Card';

<Card
  title="Premium Headphones"
  image="/images/headphones.jpg"
  price="$299"
  description="High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation"
  actions={[
    { label: "Add to Cart", onClick: handleAddToCart },
    { label: "Learn More", href: "/products/headphones" }
  ]}
/>
```

## Architecture

Spark uses a modular rule system that integrates seamlessly with Cursor IDE:

```
.cursor/rules/spark/
â”œâ”€â”€ spark.mdc                 # Main conversational rules
â”œâ”€â”€ components/               # Component-specific patterns
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accordion.mdc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card.mdc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ carousel.mdc
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dialog.mdc
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                     # Core functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ accessibility.mdc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ patterns.mdc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ production.mdc
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ testing.mdc
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each component includes:
- Conversation patterns for natural interaction
- Multiple technology implementations
- Accessibility guidelines
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Usage examples and documentation
