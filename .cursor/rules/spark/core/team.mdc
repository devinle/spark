### Intelligent Commit Messages
```typescript
interface CommitMessageTemplate {
  type: 'feat' | 'fix' | 'refactor' | 'update' | 'migrate';
  scope: string; // 'components', 'accordion', 'styling'
  description: string;
  body: {
    componentDetails: string;
    accessibilityFeatures: string;
    performanceInfo: string;

    technology: string;
    breakingChanges?: string;
  };
}
```

### Branch Strategies
```bash
@spark config git

Git Integration Configuration:

Branch Strategy:
→ Feature branches (feature/component-name) [recommended]
→ Component branches (components/accordion-v2)
→ No branching (commit to current branch)
→ Custom pattern

Commit Strategy:
→ Single commit per component [current]
→ Atomic commits (files, tests, docs separately)
→ Squash on completion

PR Integration:
→ Auto-create PR with component description
→ Add reviewers based on component type
→ Include component preview in PR description

Team Workflow:
→ Require review for all generated components
→ Auto-assign design system maintainer
→ Run automated checks before merge
```

## Multi-Developer Conflict Resolution

### Concurrent Generation Detection
```bash
# Developer A runs:
@spark accordion react

⚠️ Conflict Detected!

Mike is currently generating an accordion component in:
├── Branch: feature/product-accordion  
├── Started: 3 minutes ago
├── Type: React accordion for product details

Options:
→ Coordinate with Mike (send notification)
→ Generate in different location (/components/FAQ/)
→ Use different variant (FAQ vs Product optimized)
→ Wait for Mike to finish (estimated 2 minutes)
→ Continue anyway (may cause conflicts)

Recommend: Coordinate or use different location
```

### Review Assignment Logic
```typescript
interface ReviewAssignment {
  rules: {
    accessibility: {
      required: boolean;
      reviewers: string[];
      autoAssign: boolean;
    };
    designSystem: {
      required: boolean;
      reviewers: string[];
      autoAssign: boolean;
    };
    performance: {
      threshold: number; // Bundle size that triggers review
      reviewers: string[];
    };
    security: {
      dependencies: boolean; // New deps trigger security review
      reviewers: string[];
    };
  };
  componentSpecific: {
    [component: string]: {
      specialists: string[];
      requiredChecks: string[];
    };
  };
}
```

## Multi-Repository Support

### Monorepo Awareness
```bash
@spark accordion --package=marketing-site

🏢 Monorepo detected: Lerna + Nx workspace

Available packages:
├── marketing-site (React + Next.js)
├── admin-dashboard (React + Vite)  
├── mobile-app (React Native)
└── design-system (Shared components)

Generating accordion for: marketing-site

Package-specific settings:
├── Design tokens: @company/design-system/tokens
├── Testing: Jest with custom config
├── Bundle limits: 50KB per component
├── Browser support: Modern browsers only

Dependencies will be installed in:
packages/marketing-site/package.json

Component will be created in:
packages/marketing-site/src/components/Accordion/
```

### Cross-Package Dependencies
```bash
@spark accordion react --shared-component

🔄 Shared Component Generation

Since this accordion will be used across multiple packages,
I'll create it in the design system package:

├── Location: packages/design-system/src/Accordion/
├── Exports: @company/design-system/Accordion
├── Consumers: marketing-site, admin-dashboard  

Package updates required:
packages/marketing-site/package.json:
  "@company/design-system": "^1.2.0" → "^1.3.0"

packages/admin-dashboard/package.json:
  "@company/design-system": "^1.1.0" → "^1.3.0"

This ensures all packages use the same accordion component.
Proceed with shared component generation? (y/n)
```

## Automated Quality Gates

### Pre-Generation Checks
```bash
@spark accordion react

🔍 Running pre-generation quality checks...

✅ Git repository clean (no uncommitted changes)
✅ Dependencies up to date (no security vulnerabilities)
✅ Design system aligned (tokens current)
✅ Bundle budget available (43KB remaining)
✅ No naming conflicts detected
✅ Team standards compliant

⚠️ Performance budget warning:
Current bundle size: 157KB (limit: 200KB)
New component impact: +4.2KB
Remaining budget: 38.8KB after generation

This is within limits but approaching the threshold.
Consider code splitting for future components.

Continue with generation? (y/n)
```

### Post-Generation Validation
```bash
Component generation complete!

🧪 Running post-generation validation...

✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Linting passed (0 warnings)
✅ Unit tests passing (12/12)
✅ Accessibility tests passing (8/8)  
✅ Visual regression tests passing (4/4)
✅ Bundle size within limits (+4.2KB)
✅ Performance benchmarks met
✅ Design system compliance verified

📊 Quality Score: 98/100
├── Code quality: 100/100
├── Accessibility: 100/100  
├── Performance: 95/100 (minor optimization available)
├── Documentation: 100/100
└── Testing: 95/100 (edge case coverage suggested)

🎉 Component ready for team review!

Next steps:
→ Create PR for team review
→ Test in development environment  
→ Add to component showcase
→ Update team documentation
```

This integration system transforms Spark from an individual tool into a collaborative platform that enhances team workflows and maintains code quality across the entire development lifecycle.
