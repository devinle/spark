# Important User Responsibilities and Disclaimers - v1.0

## What Spark Provides

Spark generates component code based on established patterns and best practices. It provides:
- Code templates following accessibility guidelines
- Security-conscious coding patterns
- Performance optimization techniques  
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

## What Users Must Verify

### Code Quality and Functionality
- **Review all generated code** before using in any environment
- **Test components thoroughly** with your specific content and data
- **Validate functionality** meets your exact requirements
- **Ensure compatibility** with your existing codebase and dependencies

### Security Validation
- **Audit all code** for security vulnerabilities in your specific context
- **Review dependencies** for known security issues
- **Test input handling** and data sanitization
- **Validate authentication and authorization** if components handle user data
- **Confirm compliance** with your organization's security policies

### Accessibility Testing
- **Test with assistive technology** - screen readers, voice control, switch navigation
- **Validate with real users** who rely on assistive technology
- **Verify keyboard navigation** works correctly in your application
- **Check color contrast** in your specific design context
- **Test on actual devices** your users employ
- **Confirm WCAG compliance** using your preferred testing methodology

### Performance Verification
- **Measure performance** in your actual environment
- **Test with real content** and typical data volumes
- **Validate on target devices** and network conditions
- **Monitor bundle size impact** on your application
- **Check loading and interaction** performance

### Legal and Compliance
- **Ensure compliance** with regulations specific to your industry (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
- **Review privacy implications** of any data collection or storage
- **Validate licensing** of all dependencies and code patterns
- **Confirm accessibility compliance** meets your legal requirements

## Spark's Limitations

### What Spark Cannot Guarantee
- **Perfect code** for your specific requirements or edge cases
- **Complete security** - security depends on your implementation and environment
- **Full accessibility** - requires human testing and real-user validation  
- **Optimal performance** - depends on your specific context and usage patterns
- **Legal compliance** - varies by jurisdiction and industry
- **Compatibility** with all possible configurations and systems

### What Spark Does Not Provide
- Debugging support for production issues
- Security consultation or incident response
- Accessibility auditing or certification
- Performance optimization for specific environments
- Legal advice regarding compliance or regulations

## Recommended Verification Process

### Before Production Deployment
1. **Code Review**: Have experienced developers review all generated code
2. **Security Audit**: Use security scanning tools and manual review
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Test with assistive technology and user feedback
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure performance with realistic data and usage
5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify functionality across target browsers
6. **Mobile Testing**: Confirm responsive behavior and touch interactions
7. **Integration Testing**: Ensure components work within your larger application

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Monitor components for issues in production environments
- Keep dependencies updated with security patches
- Re-validate accessibility as standards evolve
- Test performance as your application and data grow
- Review compliance as regulations change

## How Spark Presents Information

### Language We Use
- "Includes accessibility patterns" (not "fully accessible")
- "Follows security best practices" (not "secure")
- "Based on WCAG guidelines" (not "WCAG compliant")
- "Performance-optimized templates" (not "high performance guaranteed")

### Your Responsibility to Verify
- Test accessibility with real assistive technology
- Validate security with your security tools  
- Confirm performance in your environment
- Review compliance with your legal requirements

## Getting Additional Help

### When You Need Specialists
- **Security**: Consult security professionals for audits and threat modeling
- **Accessibility**: Work with accessibility experts and disabled users
- **Legal**: Engage legal counsel for compliance and regulatory questions
- **Performance**: Partner with performance engineers for optimization

### Resources for Validation
- **Accessibility testing tools**: axe, WAVE, Lighthouse, manual testing
- **Security tools**: Static analysis, dependency scanners, penetration testing
- **Performance tools**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest, browser dev tools
- **Compliance frameworks**: Industry-specific guidelines and standards
