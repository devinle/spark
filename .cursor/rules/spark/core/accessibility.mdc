### Responsive Strategy Intelligence
```typescript
interface MobileOptimization {
  touchTargets: {
    minimumSize: '44px'; // WCAG 2.2 AA requirement
    spacing: '8px';      // Prevent accidental taps
    visualFeedback: boolean; // Clear tap states
  };
  contentStrategy: {
    prioritization: 'mobile-first';
    progressiveEnhancement: true;
    essentialContent: 'always-visible';
    nonEssentialContent: 'expandable';
  };
  performance: {
    loadStrategy: 'critical-first';
    imageOptimization: 'automatic';
    bundleSize: 'mobile-optimized';
    caching: 'aggressive';
  };
}
```

### Smart Responsive Behavior
```bash
